Installation

    The Sequence Arithmetic Framework is completeley implemented in
the <sequence> and <sequence.H> header file; only access to those
files is necessary to use it.  Therefore, building and installing is
very simple; to install, run:

	./configure		# does nothing.
	make			# builds optional unit test object, and distribution package
	make install		# copies header files to /usr/local/include

    The default installation target is /usr/local/include/; you will
likely require root priviledges to install there.

    To build and execute the (optional) Sequence Arithmetic Framework
unit tests, the Enbridge CUT Framework must be available, either
installed in the standard include path, or available in ../cut/.  To
build and execute the unit tests, run:

	make test
